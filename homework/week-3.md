# Tech Leads

Please go to the link that has been Slacked out to make your own copy of the project repo. Once you've finished copying the repo, add your teammates as collaborators and share your new repo URL with them.


# Submission

You will submit assignments via Github as follows. The process may be confusing at first, but bear with it and it'll become second nature.

1. Clone the project repo using the URL provided by your team's tech lead.
2. Checkout a new branch (`git checkout -b <BRANCH NAME GOES HERE>`). Name your branch using the convention `XXMMDD_FeatureName`, where **XX** are your initials, **MMDD** is the date and **FeatureName** is a short description of the feature you are working on.
3. Complete the assignment (easier said than done, eh?).
4. Stage and commit your changes (`git add .` then `git commit -m "completed assignment with fortitude and flair"`)
5. Submit a pull request on that unit's repo with your completed assignment. Check out Github's [pull request help page](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) if you have any issues.
6. Assign your team members to code review your pull request. Once all team members have reviewed and commented :+1: on the pull request, you can use the "Merge" button to merge your branch to master.
7. Do a little dance!
