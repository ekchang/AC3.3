1) Create a generic `SimpleList` class that is supported by an ArrayList, and that supports the following operations:

add(),

get(),

size()

2) Modify the SimpleList class so that it only accepts generic types that implement Comparable.

3) Do you think it's possible to extends your SimpleList<T> object with AdvancedList (No parameterized type).


3) Revise your HashMap object in the ParkingGarage so that it maps Strings to any subclass of Collection.
