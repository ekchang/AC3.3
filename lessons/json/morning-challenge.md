## Morning challenge :hatching_chick:

1. Create a new [JSON object](http://www.w3resource.com/JSON/introduction.php) to represent an instance of the Java class `Student`. Populate the values with your own first name, last name, ID number and three of your favorite foods.

```
public class Student {

	String firstName;

	String lastName;

	int idNumber;
	
	String[] threeFavoriteFoods;
	
}
```

2. Go to the [Slack API: Message Formatting](https://api.slack.com/docs/messages/builder). In the 'Message buttons' example, See if you can:

    - Change the name of the first game from 'Chess' to 'Checkers'.
    
    - Change the color of the message highlight to your favorite color. *Hint: you can find hex color values [here](http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp)*.
    
	- Add a fourth game/button called 'Thermonuclear JSON!!!'.

3. When you are finished, paste both JSON solutions into a new [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and submit the link using the Morning Challenge Google Form (check Slack!).
