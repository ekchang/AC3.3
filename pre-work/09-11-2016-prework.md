1. Read [Code Newbie: An Intro to APIs](http://www.codenewbie.org/blogs/an-intro-to-apis).

2. Read [w3resource: JSON](http://www.w3resource.com/JSON/introduction.php).

3. Read [Slack API: Bot Users](https://api.slack.com/bot-users).

4. Try out the [Slack API: Message Formatting](https://api.slack.com/docs/messages/builder) tool to experiment with how Slack messages are structured as JSON. See if you can:

	- Add a new line of text to the "Basic formatting" example.
    
	- Change the color of the highlight to magenta (#FF00FF) in the "Attachments" example.
    
	- Change the name of the second game to "(Your name)'s Maze" in the "Message buttons" example.
