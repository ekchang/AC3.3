Today will be an introduction to Android.
Bring the three drawings of the most used screens of your personal app to class. We will be building them.

Read the four sections and excute the instructions for building your first Android app.

If you have an Android device, then you can run the application on your phone. <br>
If not, during class we will be using the emulator.
