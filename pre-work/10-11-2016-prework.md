# Prework 10/11/2016

This class will be a repeat of Saturdays class. However, this time we will actually commit our changes and submit pull requests to the class repo.
We will also be revisiting JSON, and learning to start a web server using [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/)

Read the Creating Lists and Cards tutorial <br>
https://developer.android.com/training/material/lists-cards.html <br>


During this class, we will be building a list of fragments for the Employee Handbook in the Android Grocery Store.
You should have already created and submitted your profile_page.xml, as it will be used today.

Feel free to update your profile_page.xml and submit a pull request to AndroidGroceryStore repo.
